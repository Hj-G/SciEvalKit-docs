SciEvalKit Documentation
========================

**SciEvalKit** is an open‑source evaluation framework and leaderboard aimed at measuring the **scientific intelligence** of large language and vision–language models.
Although modern frontier models often achieve *~90* on general‑purpose benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on rigorous, domain‑specific scientific tasks—revealing a persistent **general‑versus‑scientific gap** that motivates the need for SciEval.
